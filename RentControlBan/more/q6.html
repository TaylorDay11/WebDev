			<h1>Colorado Rent Control Ban</h1>

			<h2>The rent control ban keeps the government out of the free market, but it allows rent to increase with no regulation. Which of these demographics would be negatively affected the most if their rent continues to increase at their current place?</h2>

			<div id="answer" class="a2">1. The elderly because a lot of them have fixed incomes.</div>
			<div id="answer" class="a3">2. College students because they are poor and just freshly on their own.</div>
			<div id="answer" class="a1">3. Middle age adults becuase they usually have kids and other expenses they also have to pay for.</div>

			<div class="submitbutton">Submit</div>
